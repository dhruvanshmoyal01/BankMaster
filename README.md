# BankMaster

A basic banking command-line application using Java and Eclipse. This application will be able to model real life bank functions such as adding an account, increasing/decreasing the balance of an account, and allowing a user to check their balance. We will also learn how to store basic demographic information of each account holder and learn how to output a summary of all accounts.
